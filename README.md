# LFAV

## About

This is a personal fun project with a friend, who is a writing major at Cornell to build a game. 

This is a stats simulator for players in order to prototype some backend functionality. 

### Specifications:
1. Player stats are given in a .csv file
2. Python parses it
3. Create necessary players

## How to Run
If for some reason you are interested in running this just make sure to have python installed. 

From there, cd to lfav and run it. It will automatically parse the file that is already included.
